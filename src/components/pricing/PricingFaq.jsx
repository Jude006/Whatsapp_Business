          question: "How does the 7-day free trial work?",
          answer: "You get full access to all features of your chosen plan for 7 days. No credit card required to start. After 7 days, you'll need to choose a paid plan to continue using Gentle-Tools."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens after my free trial ends?",
          answer: "Your account will be temporarily paused. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time to reactivate your account. All your data, contacts, and settings will be preserved."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I switch plans during the trial?",
          answer: "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time during the trial. Your trial period continues regardless of plan changes."

          question: "Is there any setup fee?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I pay yearly instead of monthly?",

        },
        {
          question: "When will I be charged?",
          answer: "For paid plans: After your 7-day trial ends. For immediate upgrades: You're charged immediately and get instant access to paid features."

        },
        {
          question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?",

        },
        {
          question: "Do message limits roll over to the next month?",
          answer: "Unused messages do not roll over. Your message count resets at the beginning of each billing cycle."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I use multiple WhatsApp numbers?",
          answer: "Each plan supports one connected WhatsApp number. For multiple numbers, you'll need separate subscriptions or our Business plan for team features."
